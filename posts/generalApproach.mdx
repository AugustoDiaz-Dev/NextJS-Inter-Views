The main idea of this series of articles is to help you to study and consolidate information using diverse types of resources:

# Main titles are in Violet
## Titles are in green.
### Subtitles are in light blue.
- Important cocepts or ideas are <span className="yellowHighlight">highlighted in yellow.</span>
- Links are in [<span style={{color: "var(--myBlue)"}}>blue.</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue)

You also have videos, images and code snippets.

I was getting crazy when I see 1000 JS Questions, 500 Questions on React, and so on, so I decided to divide them in chunks in order to incorporate information gradually and with diverse topics and spans of time.
